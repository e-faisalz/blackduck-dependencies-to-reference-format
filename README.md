# blackduck-dependencies-to-reference-format
## Description
Extracts dependencies from the source.csv artifact of tool __detect__ from BlackDuck (Synopsis).

Outputs two files: 
  - __dependencies_from_source.json__ contains the direct and transient (transitive) dependencies, in a reference format. This reference format is a JSON file containing arrays of objects with keys _name_ and _version_. It contains unique objects by the combination _name_ and _version_
  - __exactMatches_from_source.json__ contains the dependencies that are marked as 'Exact' match type in Blackduck, meaning that they were identified as a dependency based on matching file and/or folder structures.

### Note
It is important to mention that we chose to extract dependencies __from the source.csv__ file __instead of the components.csv__ file generated by Blackduck because we are interested in reporting on the actual dependencies, not on their grouping or aliasing to logical components as defined by BlackDuck.

# Status
1.0.2, see [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)

# Limitation
- currently supporting versions 5.2.0 and 5.6.1 of Detect
- tested with Detect output as generated by scanning projects of the following technologies: 
  - Java
  - Javascript

# Prerequisites
- you should have Node installed (this script was tested with node v12.2.0)
- you should have yarn installed (we used version v1.19.0)

# Usage
```
yarn extract-from-source [options]
```

| --input [filename] |  -i   | (mandatory) Filename of the Detect source csv file to extract dependencies from.
| --output [filename]|  -o   | (optional) Filename to which the list of dependencies is written (json format). If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. Default value: dependencies_from_source.json
| --detect [value]   |  -d   | (optional) Version of the synopsis detect tool that was used to generate the input source csv file. One of values in: [5.2.0, 5.6.1]. Defaults to 5.6.1
